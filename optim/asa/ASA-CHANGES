========================================================================
19 Oct 13

asa.c, ASA-README.ms
In the cost function, when User_Tangents is TRUE, the user should
test the incoming *cost_flag for a value of -1 (changed from FALSE) to
calculate tangents.  If ASA_QUEUE is TRUE, then the value of *cost_flag
is tested for FALSE in previous states in queue and an invalid statement
is available in the printout.

========================================================================
25 Sep 13

ASA-Makefile, ASA-README.ms
Since -mno-cygwin has been deprecated in Cygwin, there are comments to
use i686-pc-mingw32-gcc.exe, e.g.,
CC = /bin/i686-pc-mingw32-gcc.exe
to not use the cygwin1.dll library.

========================================================================
25 Jul 11

ASA-NOTES
Modified section
@@Equality Constraints
to

equality and inequality constraints.

========================================================================
15 Jun 11

ASA-README.ms
Updated references.

========================================================================
6 March 11

ASA-README.ms
ASA_FUZZY does not do well on ASA_TEST_POINT.  Added a Caution that is
appropriate for many other variants of SA:
Caution: Often ASA_FUZZY will turn on QUENCHing > 1, violating the proof
of ASA.  For many systems, this speeding up of the sampling process can
be a welcome efficiency, but in some systems global minima may be missed,
e.g., in systems with multiple scales.

ASA-README.html
fixed bug in formatting

========================================================================
5 March 11

ASA-README.ms, ASA-Makefile, asa.c, asa_usr.c, asa_usr.h
When ASA_FUZZY is set to TRUE, a modified fuzzy-logic algorithm
originally developed by Hime Junior performs an adaptive tuning of
selected ASA OPTIONS.  ASA_FUZZY has several adaptive parameters defined
in asa_usr_asa.h, and some fixed #define parameters in the several
subroutines at the bottom of asa_usr.c.  The default functions are set to
tune QUENCH_COST and QUENCH_PARAMETERS parameters, so these are tested
to be TRUE in the default asa_usr_asa.h.  If you change any defaults,
pay attention to sections labeled ASA_FUZZY at top and bottom sections
of asa_usr.c, and in asa_usr.h.

========================================================================
9 Feb 11

ASA-LICENSE, ASA-README.ms
Clause 5 was deleted, and Clause 6 was renumbered to
Clause 5, to follow guidelines of the "New BSD License",
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_License, beginning with Version 28.1.

========================================================================
14 Dec 10

asa_usr.c
Added free() and fclose() statements in SELF_OPTIMIZE functions to have
no errors reported under cppcheck.  These only occurred in places that
were returning fatal errors code anyway.

========================================================================
10 Dec 10

ASA-README.ms, ASA-Makefile, asa.c, asa_usr.c, asa_usr.h, asa_usr_asa.h, asa_usr_cst.h
When ADAPTIVE_OPTIONS is set to TRUE, it is possible to change relevant
OPTIONS in the USER_DEFINES struct in asa_usr_asa.h during run time,
by including an asa_adaptive_options file.  This can be very useful to
efficiently determine how to tune long runs.

========================================================================
16 Jul 10

ASA-LICENSE, ASA-README.ms
ftp is no longer supported to retrive ASA.

========================================================================
4 Jan 10

ASA-NOTES:
Noted that when using SUNPRO CC, the 'extern "C" {' line and its '}'
line should be commented out in [].h files.

asa_usr.c
Added (double) cast to test "if (fabs ((double) seed) > 0)".

========================================================================
4 Nov 09

ASA-README.ms:
Modified TRD reference.

========================================================================
3 Nov 09

updated version appears.

========================================================================
19 Aug 09

ASA-README.ms:
Updated references.

========================================================================
25 Jun 09

asa_usr.c:
Added number_asa_usr_open to track multiple calls to asa_usr_out,
similar to number_asa_open in asa.c that tracks multiple calls to asa_out.

========================================================================
20 Jun 09

asa_usr.c:
If your USER_COST_FUNCTION modifies your other programs, and final calls
to asa() and/or fitloc() make additional modifications, you might run
a last call to USER_COST_FUNCTION().  An ASA_TEMPLATE is provided after
FITLOC for this purpose.

========================================================================
14 Apr 09

asa.c, asa_usr.c:
Added fscanf_ret= to all fscanf calls, to stop warnings under optimization
options on some Linux platforms.

ASA-Makefile, ASA-README.ms:
Added comment that if you use gcc across different levels of compiler
optimization on different platforms, you may wish to invoke -ffloat-store
to be sure to get the same precision in your results. This option is
added to ASA-Makefile.

Added comment for Cygwin that if -mno-cygwin flag has been removed,
use a mingw-targeted cross-compiler.

========================================================================
26 Jan 09

ASA-README.ms:
Added references to some code snippets in asa_examples.txt.

========================================================================

asa.c:
Moved fopen ("asa_exit_anytime", "w") up to initialization section.

========================================================================
24 Jul 08

ASA-README.ms, asa.c, asa_usr_asa.h:
When ASA_EXIT_ANYTIME is set to TRUE, the first call to asa() creates the
file asa_exit_anytime.  To  permit IMMEDIATE_EXIT before calculating the
next generated state, simply delete the file asa_exit_anytime, and asa()
will exit with code IMMEDIATE_EXIT.  This can be useful on long runs.

========================================================================
26 May 08

ASA-LICENSE, ASA-README.ms:
Added "or publication" to Condition 4.

========================================================================
24 Apr 08

Makefile:
Corrected collecting pages for ASA-README.ps and ASA-README.pdf.

========================================================================
8 Mar 08

ASA-README-ms, asa.c:
When calculating derivatives, an invalid cost function, i.e., returning
*cost_flag = FALSE from the cost function, will exit asa() with *exit_code
INVALID_COST_FUNCTION_DERIV.  Also, when calculating derivatives, no
extra test is performed to check that parameters are within their lower
and upper bounds (since meshes for derivatives may exceed these bounds).
If this is not desired, then within the cost function, within a test
for USER_OPTIONS->Locate_Cost == 3, a decision may be made whether to
return this *exit_code.

========================================================================
20 Feb 08

asa_usr.c, asa_usr.h:
Added OPTIONAL_DATA_PTR info to asa_main() ASA_TEMPLATE.

18 Feb 08

ASA-README.ms, asa_usr.c, asa_usr.h, asa_usr_asa.h:
To enable clean compilations under c++/g++, when using user-defined
USER[] functions, added HAVE_ANSI #defines for Cost_Schedule(),
Acceptance_Test(), Generating_Distrib(), Reanneal_Cost_Function(), and
Reanneal_Params_Function().  Used const void *OPTIONS_TMP as place-holder,
similar to use in some asa.c functions, in asa_usr_asa.h and asa_usr.c,
for USER_OPTIONS and RECUR_USER_OPTIONS in referring and referred
functions in asa_usr.c.

asa_usr.c:
Corrected dereferencing of cost_last and cost_best in
user_reanneal_cost().  Wrapped all code in user_reanneal_cost() in
#define ASA_TEMPLATE.

asa.c:
moved immediate_flag in asa() to prevent warning.

ASA-README.ms:
Added some reference papers on use of ASA.  There is now an RLaB

0 otherwise.

========================================================================
19 Jul 01

asa.c, asa.h, readme.ms, user.c, user.h, user_cst.c:
Setting the lower bound equal to the upper bound will remove a parameter

If the first call to cost function returns an invalid state, then memory
is correctly freed before exiting asa().

========================================================================
16 Mar 01

asa_user.h, user.c, user.h, readme.ms:
The default name of the cost function is cost_function.  This can be
changed in asa_user.h (or the Makefile) by defining USER_COST_FUNCTION.
When SELF_OPTIMIZE is TRUE, the default name of the recur cost function is
recur_cost_function.  This can be changed in asa_user.h (or the Makefile)
by defining RECUR_USER_COST_FUNCTION.  This of course requires compiling
in the new cost function(s) and prototype(s).

========================================================================
20 Feb 01

========================================================================
24 Oct 00

readme.ms, user.h, user.c:
randflt() calls resetable_randflt() each time to implement the RNG.
This is to provide the capability of getting the same runs if the same
multiple calls to asa() are made, e.g., when using ASA_LIB set to TRUE.

========================================================================
19 Sep 00

user.c:
Changed initialization of random generator to enforce consistent
first random number generated upon multiple calls to asa_main() when
ASA_TEMPLATE_LIB is set to TRUE.  This changes test_asa and test_usr.

========================================================================
5 May 00

user.c, readme.ms:
If OPTIONAL_DATA_PTR is being used for RECUR_USER_OPTIONS as well
as for USER_OPTIONS, do not create (or free) additional memory in
recur_cost_function() for Asa_Data_Dim_Ptr and Asa_Data_Ptr to be
passed to the inner cost_function(), but rather link pointers to those
in RECUR_USER_OPTIONS.  Typically, define separate structures within the
structure defined by Asa_Data_Ptr to access info depending on whether the
run in a particular level of cost function in this recursive operation.
In user.c, there are guidelines to set "#if TRUE" to "#if FALSE"
at these points of the code.

========================================================================
3 May 00

asa.c:
Updated changes to Asa_Data_Dbl when ASA_TEMPLATE_SELFOPT is TRUE.

28 Dec 99

asa.c, readme.ms, user.c:
Deleted Cauchy and Gaussian examples under USER_GENERATED_FUNCTION, as
extra care usually is needed by user the to handle parameter ranges.

========================================================================
26 Dec 99

asa.c:
Set default size of arrays created under ASA_QUEUE to 1 if Queue_Size
is initially zero, to permit proper freeing of memory when leaving asa()
in case Queue_Size is set to zero adaptively.

========================================================================
8 Dec 99

Makefile, asa.c, asa_user.h, readme.ms:
If ASA_SAVE_OPT is set to TRUE, when asa is restarted, if the file
asa_opt_save is present in the same directory as asa_opt, then new values
of ASA parameters and OPTIONS are read in after initializing to the
point of the last writing of asa_save, without requiring recompilation.

readme.ms:
Added note on availability of MATLAB interface in asa_contrib.

========================================================================
30 Nov 99

If ASA_QUEUE and ASA_PRINT_MORE are TRUE then, whenever a queued cost
function is used, this is recorded in asa_out.

========================================================================
16 Nov 99

asa.c, asa_user.h, readme.ms, user.c;
ASA_QUEUE and ASA_RESOLUTION may be used separately or together, creating
somewhat different sampling procedures.

========================================================================
14 Nov 99

asa_user.h, readme.ms:
When ASA_SAVE_BACKUP is TRUE, ASA_SAVE is automatically set to TRUE
in asa_user.h.

========================================================================
13 Nov 99

Makefile, asa_opt, asa.c, asa_user.h, readme.ms, user.c:
If ASA_SAVE is set to TRUE, when ASA_SAVE_BACKUP is set to TRUE, asa
saves enough information after each newly best accepted state to restart
from any previous best accepted state when that asa_save.{best_state}
is copied to asa_save.  The new asa_opt file (with modified first and
last lines) can be used to insert new code before restarting runs.

========================================================================
10 Nov 99

readme.ms:
Added more references to arrays to be developed under several OPTIONS,
adding more hyperlinks in ASA-README.html.

========================================================================
4 Nov 99

========================================================================
21 Sep 99

asa.c, readme.ms, user.c:
Added comments re use of USER_ACCEPT_ASYMP_EXP to be used as a template
for USER_ACCEPTANCE_TEST.  Moved some declarations inside #if
statements to avoid unnecessary warnings of unused variables.

========================================================================
8 Sep 99

asa.c, asa.h, readme.ms:
Added INVALID_COST_FUNCTION_DERIV with an exit code of 9, to tell user
when an invalid cost function or parameter is developed within the
calculation of numerical derivatives, causing an asa() exit.

========================================================================

Makefile, asa_user.h, readme.ms, user.c:
Added USER_OUT to permit naming of user output file, defaults to "user_out."

========================================================================
4 Feb 99

readme.ms, user.c:
If FITLOC is TRUE, a value of Fit_Local set >= 1 is required to enter
the local code.  If Fit_Local is set to 2, any better fit found by the
local code better than asa() is ignored if that local fit is achieved
by violating the ranges of the parameters.

========================================================================
27 Jan 99

asa.c:
Corrected a few casts used when ASA_SAVE is TRUE.

========================================================================
15 Jan 99

asa.c, asa.h, readme.ms:
Generalized the macro COST_FUNCTION_TEST to the function
cost_function_test() to return exit_code INVALID_COST_FUNCTION if the
user returns either an invalid cost function value or a parameter that
lies outside the proper range.

========================================================================
26 Sep 98

asa.c, asa.h, readme.ms, user.c, user.h:
CALLOC_FAILED = -1.  Calloc memory allocation has failed in asa.c.
This error will call Exit_ASA(), the location will be printed to
stdout, and asa() will return  the double -1 to the calling program.
In user.c, if asa() returns this *exit_code a warning will be printed
both to stdout and to user_out.

asa_main() now returns an integer.  main() or asa_main() returns 0 for
a normal run, -1 if any calloc allocation has failed in asa.c, or -2 if
any calloc allocation has failed in user.c.

initialize_parameters() and recur_initialize_parameters() also now
return integers, 0 for a normal run or -2 if any calloc allocation has
failed.

asa.c:
print_string() and print_string_index() return errors in user input
both to stdout and, if ASA_PRINT is TRUE, to ASA_OUT.

========================================================================
25 Sep 98

========================================================================
12 Jul 98

asa.c:
More print statements added when MULTI_MIN is set to TRUE.

asa.c, asa_user.c, readme.ms, user.c:
If Multi_Specify is set to 0, the selection of best-generated states
includes all sampled instances of the cost functions.  If Multi_Specify
is set to 1, the selection of best-generated states is constrained to
include only those with different values of the cost function.

========================================================================
9 Jul 98

asa.c, readme.ms:
Included some commented alternative code under "cost-value-distinct
best-generated states" which can alter the default selection of all
best-generated states to including only those with different values of
the cost function.

asa.c, readme.ms:
Modified MULTI_MIN algorithm.  Added tests to ensure that Multi_Grid is
greater than EPS_DOUBLE, greater than Coarse_Resolution if
ASA_RESOLUTION is TRUE, and greater than Queue_Size if ASA_QUEUE is
TRUE.

========================================================================
8 Jul 98

asa.c, user.c:
Added print statements to user.c and corrected some code in asa.c when
MULTI_MIN is set to TRUE.

asa.c:
Modified parameters in multi_compare() for non-ANSI compilers.

asa.c, readme.ms:
If MULTI_MIN is TRUE and Curvature_0 is FALSE, all MULTI_NUMBER
curvatures are calculated.

asa.c, readme.ms:
Clarified calculation of the MULTI_NUMBER lowest best-generated sampled
values of the cost function.  Enhanced MULTI_MIN algorithm to include
Multi_Grid.

========================================================================
7 Jul 98

Makefile, asa.c, asa.h, asa_user.h, readme.ms, user.c:
When MULTI_MIN is set to TRUE, the lowest MULTI_NUMBER values of the
cost function and their parameters are saved.

========================================================================
18 Jun 98

readme.ms:
Updated references.

========================================================================
9 Jan 98

asa.c, asa_user.h, readme.ms, user.c, user.c:
When FITLOC is TRUE, OPTIONS->Iter_Max determines the maximum
iterations of the cost_function () by simplex ().  This replaces
intermax.

========================================================================
8 Jan 98

user.c:
Added some declarations in calcf() when ASA_RESOLUTION set to TRUE.

========================================================================
28 Dec 97

user.c:
Added reference to simplex code.

========================================================================
18 Dec 97

Makefile, asa.c, asa_user.h, readme.ms, user.c:
When FITLOC is set to TRUE, FITLOC_PRINT controls printing in fitloc ()
and simplex () in the user module.

========================================================================
7 Dec 97

Makefile, asa.c, asa_user.h, readme.ms, user.c:
If FITLOC is set to TRUE and FITLOC_ROUND is TRUE, then each time
parameters are passed to or between the local routines, simplex (),
calcf (), and fitloc (), they are first processed by rounding integers
or respecting rounding according to ASA_RESOLUTION constraints prior to
any further calculations.

========================================================================
5 Dec 97

user.c:
Fixed return of information from fitloc().

========================================================================
1 Dec 97

asa.c:
Fixed bug in test for FITLOC OPTIONS settings.

========================================================================
30 Nov 97

asa.c, asa_user.h, readme.ms, user.c, user.h: 
When FITLOC is TRUE, OPTIONS->Penalty provides adaptive control of
weights for violations of constraints, exceeding boundaries, etc.
Some typos were corrected in the sections added for FITLOC.

Changed name of README's to ASA-README's.

========================================================================
29 Nov 97

Makefile, NOTES, asa.c, asa_user.h, readme.ms, user.c, user.h:
When FITLOC is set to TRUE, three subroutines become active to perform
a local fit after leaving asa ().  This can be useful to shunt asa ()
to a local code after the region of the global fit is known with some
confidence, which many times is an efficient procedure.

Changed the default of IO_PROTOTYPES to FALSE since newer operating
systems require this.

README.html is now bundled together with the ASA code.

========================================================================
7 Nov 97

asa.c, asa.h:
Removed ASA_PRINT constraints around TIME_CALC so time routines
can be used by the user module even when ASA_PRINT is FALSE.

asa.c:
Corrected test on Curvature_0.

========================================================================
26 Aug 97

asa.c, asa.h, readme.ms:
The exit flag INVALID_COST_FUNCTION is set to 8 when the user returns a
value of the cost function to asa () which is not a valid number, e.g.,
not between -MAX_DOUBLE and MAX_DOUBLE.

Updated Locate_Cost.  The value is printed out when exiting asa().

========================================================================
23 Aug 97

asa.c, readme.ms:
ASA_RESOLUTION acts at max and min boundaries similar to how integers
are treated.  ASA_RESOLUTION takes precedence over parameter_type []
when parameter_type [] is integral when calculating new generated
parameters.

========================================================================
6 Aug 97

NOTES:
Some exception fault "errors" on some PC compilers that have problems
handling too large and/or too small exponentials  can be circumvented
by setting CHECK_EXPONENT set to TRUE.

asa.c, asa.h, readme.ms:
An additional module for using TIME_CALC set to TRUE, setting
TIME_GETRUSAGE to FALSE, is more portable to compile across some
platforms, but it can require different parameters for timing results.

========================================================================
15 Jul 97

readme.ms:
Changed a typo, using cost_exit instead of cost_flag.

========================================================================
10 Jan 97

asa.c, asa_user.h, readme.ms, user.c:
In asa_user.h, the OPTIONS *Best_Cost and *Best_Parameters are pointers
to the saved best state calculated in asa(), and Locate_Cost is set to
12 instead of 2 if newly generated parameters enter the cost function
just after a new best state is achieved.  The ASA_TEMPLATE just after
the comment MY_TEMPLATE_diminishing_ranges in user.c illustrates the
use.

asa.c, asa_user.h, readme.ms, user.c:
Similarly, in asa_user.h, the OPTIONS *Last_Cost (replacing Last_Cost,
used when USER_ACCEPTANCE_TEST is TRUE) and *Last_Parameters are
pointers to the last saved state calculated in asa().

========================================================================
30 Dec 96

NOTES, asa.c, readme.ms, user.c, user.h:
When USER_GENERATING_FUNCTION is true, the functions defined by
Generating_Distrib [user_generating_distrib(), and
recur_user_generating_distrib() if SELF_OPTIMIZE is TRUE] include the
passed array last_saved_parameter[].  This array contains all the last
saved parameters, which are sometimes required for algorithms requiring
decisions based on all current parameters.

MY_TEMPLATE_[...] to aid user-defined insertions of code in user.c and
in asa_user.h when MY_TEMPLATE is set to TRUE (the default).

========================================================================
9 Jun 96

readme.ms, user.c:
If the value of seed fed to asa_seed() is less than 0, this signals the
default randflt() to initialize the array of seeds to be shuffled.
This is especially useful when using repeated calls to asa_main() when

trimmed version of the ASA_TEST problem.  The default for COST_FILE is
now TRUE.  The version with more documentation and hooks for various
templates is cost_function() in user.c

readme.ms:
Added notes that N_Accepted and N_Generated typically will have values
less in the cost function than in the ASA_OUT file, since these are
only incremented after passing some tests back in asa().

OPTIONS these use are defined in asa_user.h.

========================================================================
19 Apr 95

asa.c, readme.ms:
Modified reanneal() to set the scale of the annealing of the cost
temperature within the scale of the minimum of the current cost

{FDLIBM_EXP, FDLIBM_LOG, FDLIBM_POW}.

========================================================================
13 Apr 95

readme.ms:
In the User Options section, emphasis is placed on the ability to
calculate defaults when the Program Options or the DEFINE_OPTIONS pull
in new code.

asa.c, asa_user.h, readme.ms, user.c:
In reanneal(), the algorithm for rescaling the initial cost function
temperature is now taken to be the min of the initial cost temperature
and the max of {cost_best, cost_last, EPS_DOUBLE}, to handle cases
where at the time reanneal() is called the cost function might be at
zero or going from a positive value through zero on its way to a
negative value.

CHANGES, Makefile, NOTES, asa.c, asa_opt, asa_user.h, readme.ms, user.c:
Program Options used to trigger required settings of additional Program
Options of arrays in the user module, {User_Initial_Cost_Temp,
Ratio_Temperature_Scales, User_Initial_Parameters_Temps,

DEFINE_OPTIONS, {USER_INITIAL_COST_TEMP, RATIO_TEMPERATURE_SCALES,
USER_INITIAL_PARAMETERS_TEMPS, DELTA_PARAMETERS, QUENCH_PARAMETERS,
QUENCH_COST}, and they were removed from asa_opt.

========================================================================
12 Apr 95

asa.c, user.c, user.h:
In reanneal() in asa.c, added EPS_DOUBLE to calculation of
*initial_cost_temperature to prevent problems when cost_last goes to
zero when entering reanneal().  Such circumstances still require use of
Reanneal_Cost_Function to perform some alternative algorithm in
user_reanneal_cost() and recur_user_reanneal_cost().

Makefile, asa.c, asa_opt, asa_user.h, user.c, readme.ms:
Moved OPTIONS Maximum_Reanneal_Index and Reanneal_Rescale to
DEFINE_OPTIONS MAXIMUM_REANNEAL_INDEX and REANNEAL_SCALE, since they
likely are not ever used adaptively.  Maximum_Reanneal_Index  and
Reanneal_Rescale have been removed from asa_opt.

NOTES, readme.ms:
Moved discussion from NOTES to readme.ms on which options to put into
the Program Options and which to put into the DEFINE_OPTIONS.

========================================================================
6 Apr 95

readme.ms:

asa.c, asa_user.c, readme.ms, user.c:
Added COST_FILE to permit using a separate file to define the cost
function.

========================================================================
8 Feb 95

CHANGES, readme.ms:
Added CONTENTS and section headers to facilitate using this file.

LICENSE:
Changed DISCLAIMER to caps & lower case instead of all caps.

========================================================================
7 Feb 95

asa.c:
Moved calculation of curr_cost_temp in accept_new_state() out of set of
initial tests when USER_ACCEPTANCE_TEST is TRUE.

asa.c, asa_user.h, readme.ms, user.c:
Added OPTIONS->Prob_Bias when ASA_SAMPLE is TRUE to permit calculation
of sampling statistics even when USER_ACCEPTANCE_TEST is TRUE.

========================================================================
5 Feb 95

All files:
The names of all OPTIONS were changed to caps & lower case to help
distinguish them from other DEFINES.

========================================================================
1 Feb 95

LICENSE:
Changed from use of GPL COPYING license to a simpler LICENSE, based in
part on a University of California License, whose intent is to protect
the integrity of the algorithm, promote widespread usage, and require
reference to current source code.

asa.c, readme.ms, user.c:
An approach to using ASA_SAMPLE to perform integrals was added to
sample() in user.c.  The OPTIONS->Bias_Acceptance calculation in the
user module now includes the complement of the Boltzmann test if the
new state is not accepted.  Warnings were placed in readme.ms to be
sure to copy code from the asa module to the user module if
USER_ACCEPTANCE_TEST is set to TRUE when other OPTIONS like ASA_SAMPLE
also are activated.

========================================================================
27 Jan 95

user.c:
Included example of calling acceptance criteria within the cost
function when both USER_ACCEPTANCE_TEST and ASA_TEMPLATE are TRUE.

========================================================================
25 Jan 95

Makefile, NOTES, asa.c, asa.h, asa_user.c, user.c, user.h, readme.ms:
When USER_ACCEPTANCE_TEST is TRUE, some additional variables become
available to the OPTIONS and STATE structures.  When applicable, this
permits an acceptance test within the user_cost-function() as well as
in the USER_OPTIONS->user_acceptance_test(), e.g., to decide if the
acceptance test will fail based on only a partial calculation of the
cost function.

asa.c:
Corrected several calls to fread and fwrite when ASA_SAVE is TRUE.

========================================================================
18 Jan 95

Makefile:
Modified target "doc:" to keep README+ instead of README+.uu.

NOTES:
Added section explaining the use of Temperature_Ratio_Scale and
Temperature_Anneal_Scale.

asa_opt:
Put NOTE at bottom to keep all comment lines with no extra "white"
spaces.

readme.ms:
Mentioned section just above in NOTES, and added more info on searching
for locations in user.c to place cost_function().

user.c:
Print out final cost function and parameters in user_out.

========================================================================
13 Jan 95

All files:
Added DEFINE_OPTIONS OPTIONS_FILE_DATA to permit reading most
initialization data from asa_opt.  This should suffice for most
applications, just requiring insertion of the user's cost_function into
user.c.  Similarly, RECUR_OPTIONS_FILE and RECUR_OPTIONS_FILE_DATA were
added for use when SELF_OPTIMIZE is TRUE.

Added comments around MY_COST locations.

========================================================================
12 Jan 95

All files:
Updated Copyright 1995 notices.

========================================================================
10 Jan 95

readme.ms:
Added note to consider a possible use of Quenching OPTIONS when
adaptively modifying the number of active parameters in the fit.

========================================================================
30 Dec 94

readme.ms:
Corrected typos in describing use of OPTIONS->User_Cost_Temperature.

========================================================================
20 Dec 94

user.c:
Included examples of Cauchy and Gaussian distributions in
[recur]_user_generating_function().

========================================================================
19 Dec 94

asa.c, asa.h, readme.ms, user.c, user.h:
Corrected use of commented modifications to
[recur_]user_generating_function() by passing init_param_temp_v which
can change during reannealing.

asa.c, asa.h, readme.ms, user.c, user.h:
For USER_ACCEPTANCE_TEST, added more parameters to
[recur_]user_acceptance_test() on the same order as given to
[recur_]user_generating_function().

========================================================================
18 Dec 94

Makefile, NOTES, asa.c, asa.h, asa_user.h, readme.ms, user.c, user.h:
Added USER_GENERATING_FUNCTION to permit using an alternative function
to the ASA distribution for generating new states.
Changed name of COST_PARAMETER_SCALE to Cost_Parameter_Scale_Ratio.

========================================================================
17 Dec 94

Makefile, NOTES, asa.c, asa.h, asa_user.h, readme.ms, user.c, user.h:
Added USER_ACCEPTANCE_TEST to permit using an alternative function to
the Boltzmann distribution for the acceptance test.

========================================================================
16 Dec 94

Makefile, NOTES, asa.c, asa.h, asa_opt, asa_user.h, readme.ms, user.c, user.h:
Added OPTIONS->Reanneal_Parameters and OPTIONS->Reanneal_Cost to
independently control reannealing of the cost temperature and the
parameter temperatures.
Added USER_REANNEAL_PARAMETERS and USER_REANNEAL_COST to control
reannealing of temperatures with user-defined functions in user.c.
Breaking out separate algorithms for the cost temperature can be very
useful for systems where the scales of the acceptance criteria do not
simply correlate the cost temperature with the current best value of
the cost function.

========================================================================
15 Dec 94

NOTES:
Added sub-topics for searches on keywords.  Added reference to use of
parameter_minimum[] and parameter_maximum[] in the README to discussion
of Equality Constraints.

readme.ms:
Added mention of use of searches on key words in files in browser or
editor.

========================================================================
13 Dec 94

NOTES:
Expanded discussion on Equality Constraints.

========================================================================
8 Dec 94

NOTES, readme.ms:
Added some comments addressing the possible use of the Quenching
OPTIONS to slow down annealing by setting User_Quench_Param_Scale[] to
values less than 1.

========================================================================
7 Dec 94

readme.ms:
Added example of use of adaptively using parameter_lower_bound[] and
parameter_upper_bound[] to efficiently check subsets of new
cost_parameters[] in cost_function() for correlated constraints.

NOTES:
Updated some comments to reflect recent changes in the code.

========================================================================

Makefile:
Added OPTIONAL_DATA_INT.

========================================================================
12 Nov 94

asa.c, asa.h, readme.ms:
Added SYSTEM_CALL[TRUE] to permit user to avoid system call in asa.c,
to copy asa_save to asa_save.old, on machines that do not permit these
commands.

========================================================================
8 Nov 94 [modified 14 Apr 95]

Makefile, asa.c, asa_user.h:
In Makefile, set USER_INITIAL_COST_TEMP and
USER_INITIAL_PARAMETERS_TEMPS to TRUE when ASA_SAVE and ASA_TEMPLATE
are TRUE, to bypass any calculations of the user cost function and use
of the random number generator before asa_save is read in.  This also
gives the user the option of saving all shuffled random seeds in the
user module.

asa.c:
When ASA_SAVE is TRUE, all OPTIONS are saved in case they have been
adaptively changed by the user.

asa.c, asa.h, asa_user.h, readme.ms, user.c, user.h:
Added the Program Option OPTIONAL_DATA_INT to save integer data if
required.

========================================================================

========================================================================
23 Oct 94

asa.c, asa.h, asa_user.h, readme.ms, user.c:
Corrected ASA_PARALLEL code by adding OPTIONS->Gener_Block.
Permit OPTIONS->Gener_Block_Max to be greater than number of
processors.

asa.c, readme.ms:
If and when OPTIONS->Gener_Mov_Avr is set to 0, then
OPTIONS->Gener_Block is not changed thereafter.

========================================================================
22 Oct 94

asa.c, asa.h, asa_user.h, readme.ms, user.c:
Introduced some hooks as a structure for a parallelized ASA.

========================================================================
20 Oct 94

user.c:
In the ASA_TEMPLATE for ASA_SAMPLE, User_Tangents is set to TRUE to
illustrate the use of this OPTIONS.

========================================================================
19 Oct 94

asa.c, asa_user.h, readme.ms, user.c:
Added OPTIONS->User_Tangents[FALSE] to permit user to calculate
tangents[] when User_Tangents is set to TRUE, instead of using the
default numerical evaluation.

asa.c:
The value of number_invalid_generated_states is now kept track of
during the calculation of derivatives.

========================================================================
13 Oct 94

asa.c, asa.h:
Created asa_print_options() to move printing of user's options to a
separate procedure, making it easier to read asa.c.

========================================================================
11 Oct 94

user.c:
Changed cast on kranf in randflt() to unsigned to permit use of
arbitrary values, e.g., that might arise from using task id's.

asa.c, asa.h:
For the sake of some efficiency, MIN_EXPONENT and MAX_EXPONENT,
arguments to the macro EXPONENT_CHECK(), were changed to static
variables.

asa.c:
A bug was corrected in one of the loops testing both
Sequential_Parameters and PARAMETER_RANGE_TOO_SMALL(), that could cause
a never-ending loop.

========================================================================
5 Oct 94

NOTES, readme.ms:
Added emphasis in OPTIONS FOR LARGE SPACES section that these
suggestions are to _speed up_ annealing/quenching, while some
suggestions in the README are to _slow down_ annealing.

========================================================================
3 Oct 94

Makefile, NOTES, readme.ms:
Used a more standard format for FLAGS, replacing CFLAGS with
CDEBUGFLAGS, CFLAGS and LDFLAGS.

========================================================================
30 Sep 94

NOTES:
Added simple routine to enable users to change random seed.

asa.c, asa.h, asa_user.h, readme.ms:

user.c:
Deleted free statements for USER_OPTIONS->Cost_Schedule,
USER_OPTIONS->Reanneal_Params_Function, RECUR_USER_OPTIONS->Cost_Schedule,
RECUR_USER_OPTIONS->Reanneal_Params_Function which causes crashes on some
machines when USER_COST_SCHEDULE and USER_REANNEAL_PARAMETERS are used.

user.c:
Fixed memory leak when ASA_SAMPLE=TRUE.

========================================================================
4 Jun 94

NOTES:
Removed contributed code that had Copyright other than the GPL.

user.c:
Slowed down USER_COST_SCHEDULE in sample() when ASA_SAMPLE and
ASA_TEMPLATE are TRUE (template in Makefile) to permit better sampling
at all four local optima of the test function.

========================================================================
27 May 94

Makefile, asa.c, asa_user.h, readme.ms, user.c, user.h:
When ASA_SAMPLE is set to TRUE, data is collected by ASA during its
global optimization process to importance-sample the user's variable
Five OPTIONS become available to monitor the sampling: N_Accepted,
Bias_Acceptance, Bias_Generated, Average_Weights, and Limit_Weights.

========================================================================
4 May 94

NOTES:
Included more info on using time modules on PCs.

========================================================================
13 Apr 94

user.c:
Placed comments on using 'ptr_out = stdout;' if printout is desired to
stdout instead of user_out.

========================================================================
10 Apr 94

asa.c, asa.h, readme.ms, user.h:
ASA can print to stdout if ASA_OUT or USER_OPTIONS->Asa_Out_File is set
to "STDOUT".  #include <string.h> was added to asa.h and user.h.

Makefile, asa.c, asa.h, asa_user.h, readme.ms, user.c, user.h:
Created asa_user.h to contain all common definitions and macros
previously repeated in asa.h and user.h.

asa.c, asa.h, asa_user.h, readme.ms, user.c, user.h:
The time module was redefined in the user and asa modules so that only
one copy of this code now resides in asa.c

asa.c:
At the risk of offending C purists, a goto EXIT_ASA was inserted at
several locations, eliminating over 300 lines of code, making this file
more readable (usually the rationale for _not_ using goto).

========================================================================
8 Apr 94

readme.ms:
Put in caution that passing asa.[13nl] which is the equivalent of
README[+] through man may strip out some items like \\"asa_out\\".

asa.c, asa.h, readme.ms, user.c, user.h:
Added Limit_Generated OPTION, but now permit either Limit_Acceptances
or Limit_Generated to take 0 to run without these constraints, e.g.,
which can be useful for machines that do not process large integers.

readme.ms:
Defined Table of Contents at end.

========================================================================
7 Apr 94

readme.ms:
Added an index of all headers.

========================================================================
6 Apr 94

The inclusion of user-defined functional changes in addition to ASA
parameter modifications justifies a change in the major version
number.

asa.c:
Made off-diagonal curvature calculation a bit more efficient.

NOTES, readme.ms:
Added some information on the use of USER_COST_SCHEDULE.

========================================================================
5 Apr 94

asa.c:
Curvatures are now calculated correctly at boundaries of specified
ranges.

asa.c:
Some initialization equations were copied into the main annealing loop
to permit greater adaptive use of Temperature_Ratio_Scale,
Temperature_Anneal_Scale, Cost_Parameter_Scale_Ratio, QUENCH_PARAMETERS
and QUENCH_COST OPTIONS.

readme.ms:
Added comment on using QUENCH_COST OPTION to slow down cost temperature
schedule.

asa.c, asa.h, readme.ms, user.c, user.h:
The function used for the cost_function temperature  schedule is of the
form test_temperature in asa.c.  You can define your own function of
test_temperature adaptively in user.c in Cost_Schedule() (and in
recur_Cost_Schedule() if SELF_OPTIMIZE is TRUE) by setting the
Pre-Compile DEFINE_OPTIONS USER_COST_SCHEDULE to TRUE.

========================================================================

user.c:
I wrote the ASA test problem from scratch to closely follow its
published description.  It now runs a bit faster under gcc.

========================================================================
27 Jan 94

Makefile, asa.c, asa.h, readme.ms, user.c, user.h, TESTS/asa...:
Added Pre-Compile DEFINE_OPTIONS USER_REANNEAL_PARAMETERS.  When this is
TRUE, the user can define the reannealing function, adaptively if
required, in user.c in function user_reanneal() (and in
recur_user_reanneal() if SELF_OPTIMIZE is TRUE).

========================================================================
18 Jan 94

NOTES:
The section PAPERS USING ASA was broken out into a separate file,
asa_papers, in ftp.caltech.edu:pub/ingber.  This is to minimize
updating versions of the ASA directory due to changes in this section.

========================================================================
17 Jan 94

under PAPERS USING ASA.

========================================================================
23 Oct 93

asa.c:
INT_ALLOC and INT_LONG defines had to be corrected around a few
fprintf statements.

readme.ms, TESTS:
On the Sun, gcc-2.5.0 update runs were performed.  Since the change in
definitions of MIN_DOUBLE and MAX_DOUBLE, setting SMALL_FLOAT=E-12 does
not agree with SMALL_FLOAT=E-18 and SMALL_FLOAT=E-20 (the latter two
agree), unless MIN_DOUBLE=E-18 also is set.

========================================================================
15 Oct 93

asa.c:
Added print statements for some additional OPTIONS.

readme.ms:
Due to the increased volume of interaction, I had to insert statements
that I cannot assume the task of mailing out hardcopies of code or
papers, and that my time assisting people with their queries on my
codes and papers must be limited to electronic mail correspondence.

========================================================================
14 Oct 93

Makefile, asa.c, asa.h, readme.ms, user.c, user.h:
Added ASA_TEST[FALSE] to be set to TRUE to use ASA test problem.  This
permits users to add their own problem without having to overwrite the
ASA test example.

Added ASA_TEMPLATE[FALSE] wrappers around tests associated with several
OPTIONS.  This permits use of these OPTIONS without having to delete
these extra tests.

========================================================================
18 Sep 93

user.c:
Added reference for RNG used in the user module.

========================================================================
24 Sep 93

NOTES:
Added reference to Wall Street Journal article mentioning ASA.

========================================================================
13 Sep 93

NOTES, TESTS/HP_gcc:
Added update on modifications available for HP machines.  Added HP_gcc

========================================================================
29 Jun 93

asa.c, asa.h, user.c, user.h:
Moved prototypes for getrusage() from .c to .h files, together with
other prototypes.

user.c:
Found a Bus error during run for some versions of gcc (2.2.2 on a
sparc/4.1.3) when using `#define ARRAY_LIMIT *parameter_dimension'
when 'if __GNUC__' is TRUE, so this was set to `#define ARRAY_LIMIT
*parameter_dimension 4'.

Makefile, asa.h, user.h, readme.ms, TESTS/*_*:
Set default of TIME_CALC to FALSE since it gives trouble on many
machines.

NOTES:
Added contributed code to permit time routines to work on HPs.

8 Jun 93

Makefile, asa.c, asa.h, asa_opt, readme.ms, user.c, user.h, TESTS/...:
Changed name of MAX_FLOAT to MAX_DOUBLE.  Changed name of MIN_FLOAT
to MIN_DOUBLE.  Added EPS_DOUBLE to default to SMALL_FLOAT.  This is
considered a precursor to getting better contributions to defining
these values at a later date.  Made default of Cost_Precision to
1.0E-18, independent of these other values.  TESTS are not effected.

========================================================================
6 Jun 93

user.c:
Shortened the names of some variable asa_out* files to not exceed
8 characters.

asa.c, asa.h, readme.ms:
Added FUNCTION_REANNEAL_PARAMS in asa.h to give users more control over the
function determining reannealing.

========================================================================
5 Jun 93

Makefile, asa.c, readme.ms, TESTS/asa...:
Use SMALL_FLOAT for NO_PARAM_TEMP_TEST and NO_COST_TEMP_TEST (new names
for NO_P_TEMP_TEST and NO_C_TEMP_TEST) if they are TRUE.  Sharpened
tests of temperatures for NO_PARAM_TEMP_TEST and NO_COST_TEMP_TEST
set to FALSE.  Now all test cases agree in intermediate values.
TESTS/SUN_E-12 was deleted.

========================================================================
4 Jun 93

asa.c, asa.h, readme.ms, TESTS/asa...:
Added NO_P_TEMP_TEST and NO_C_TEMP_TEST Pre-Compile options for
testing purposes.

========================================================================
2 Jun 93

asa.c:
Fixed bug in reanneal() by placing some fabs() for some arguments
of pow().

Fixed bug in fclose() by placing statement at end of asa_exit().
This affected calculations with SELF_OPTIMIZE= TRUE.

user.c:
Edited SELF_OPTIMIZE=TRUE and USER_ASA_OUT=TRUE sections.

========================================================================
31 May 93

asa.c:
Adjusted initialization of *number_acceptances_saved = 0.

TESTS/:
All tests were updated.

user.c:
Added USER_ASA_OUT to SELF_OPTIMIZE=TRUE portion, and cleaned up
USER_ASA_OUT calls in SELF_OPTIMIZE=FALSE portions.

========================================================================
25 May 93

NOTES:
Added CONTENTS with SECTION_NAMES to search on topics.

========================================================================
29 May 93

Makefile, asa.c, asa.h, readme.ms, user.c, user.h, TESTS/asa...:
Added Pre-Compile Option USER_ASA_OUT to work with Program Option
*Asa_Out_File, to permit dynamic naming of asa() output files from
the user module.

========================================================================
24 May 93

NOTES, readme.ms:
Reorganized some references, and started list of ASA (p)reprints at
the bottom of this file, instead of increasing length of readme.ms.

asa.c:
Minor cleaning up of some statements, taking out extra parentheses.

========================================================================
22 May 93

longname.h:
Removed and made obsolete by changes in a few parameter names in the
asa module.

asa.c, asa.h, readme.ms, user.c, user.h, TESTS/asa...:
Changed all (*[a-zA-Z_]). constructs to [a-zA-Z_]-> to improve
readability.  The original form was to minimize notation for many
users, but the use of many *OPTIONS calls made this change more
reasonable.

========================================================================
17 May 93

asa.c:
Corrected typo bugs in reanneal() introduced when inserted
OPTIONS->User_Quench_Param_Scale[] factors.

========================================================================
16 May 93

asa.c, asa.h, asa_opt, readme.ms, user.c, user.h, TESTS/asa...:
Introduced two QUENCH_PARAMETERS and QUENCH_COST, to permit some
"quenching" especially in very large parameter spaces.

========================================================================
15 May 93

asa.h, user.c, user.h:
Added a __GNUC__ define.  This is useful to set ARRAY_LIMIT to
*parameter_dimension in user.c when using gcc.

asa.c, asa.h:
Removed some superfluous parameters from parameter lists.

========================================================================
15 May 93

asa.c:
Enforced fflush() for updated new best states for printout for large
parameter spaces.

readme:
ASA now can be obtained from ftp.caltech.edu where it can be maintained
in a timely manner.

========================================================================
14 May 93

asa.c:
Reorganized use of ASA_PRINT_INTERMED to be more useful for large
dimensions.

readme:
Added some comments to Program Options for large dimensions.

========================================================================
13 May 93

readme:
Updated instructions for retrieval of files.  The previous instructions
were too terse for some users.

========================================================================
11 May 93

asa.c, asa.h:
Deleted unused references to ASA_OPTIONS and ADAPTIVE define.

readme.ms:
Edited in several places and updated section on availability.

========================================================================
9 May 93

Makefile, asa.c, asa.h, readme.ms, user.c, user.h:
Added *Asa_Data to *OPTIONS when the Pre-Compile option OPTIONAL_DATA
is set to TRUE.  This permits additional information to be returned
to the user module from the asa module.  An example of usage is given
for the test problem when SELF_OPTIMIZE is TRUE.

========================================================================
8 May 93

Makefile, asa.h, readme.ms:
ASA_PRINT_INTERMED[=TRUE] is added as a Pre-Compile option.  This is
useful for large parameter spaces as well as when SELF_OPTIMIZE is
set to TRUE.

user.c:
The test problem is modified to set the dimension and indexing of
all arrays to correspond to *parameter_dimension.  This is useful to
easily change the test problem, e.g., to test large parameter spaces.

user.c:
Added some output at the end of a run when SELF_OPTIMIZE is TRUE,
in case ASA_PRINT is FALSE.

asa.c:
Closed off several fclose() statements used when SELF_OPTIMIZE is TRUE,
but ASA_PRINT is FALSE

========================================================================
7 May 93

asa.c:
Corrected allocation of memory to temperature_scale_parameters when
RATIO_TEMPERATURE_SCALES is set to TRUE.

========================================================================
5 May 93

readme.ms:
Latest updates of code and papers may be retrieved via anonymous ftp
from ftp.caltech.edu in the pub/ingber directory.

========================================================================
27 Apr 93

Makefile, asa.c, asa.h, readme.ms, user.h:
The cast on *number_parameters is set by ALLOC_INT which defaults to
the cast of LONG_INT.  On some machines, ALLOC_INT might have to be
set to TRUE to set this cast to int if there is a strict requirement
to use an unsigned int for calloc.

========================================================================
5 Apr 93

vfsr.c:
Removed old code that was inadvertently left in, with an fclose()
call for NORMAL exit.  This prevented printing to the same file when
requesting multiple calls to vfsr() from the user module.  Conditionals
were added to have printout distinguish between multiple calls and
recursive calls.  Thanks to Graham Campbell <campbell@ams.sunysb.edu>
for finding this bug.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
NOTES:
Thanks to Eric Grosse <ehg@research.att.com> for suggesting that we can
trim down the size of the code by editing the NOTES to keep it current.

========================================================================
2 Apr 93

NOTES, readme.ms:
Added some code for precise exiting of vfsr on demand, contributed
by Walter Roberson <roberson@hamer.ibd.nrc.ca>.

========================================================================
29 Mar 93

NOTES:
Mentioned apparent need to link with -ldl on some HP's.  The problem
was solved by Walter Roberson <roberson@hamer.ibd.nrc.ca>.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
readme.ms, user.c, user.h, vfsr.c, vfsr.h, vfsr_opt:
Extensive reordering was performed on all function calls to have them
appear more logically grouped.

========================================================================
27 Mar 93

readme.ms:
Mentioned FTPmail as alternative source for getting files if Netlib
or Statlib cannot be accessed.

Formatted README for pagination to facilitate printing on an ascii
printer.

========================================================================
24 Mar 93

Makefile, user.c, user.h, vfsr.c, vfsr.h:
Added template to illustrate how to use vfsr to self-optimize its
Program Options using SELF_OPTIMIZE=TRUE.

========================================================================
22 Mar 93

Makefile, readme.ms user.c, user.h, vfsr.c, vfsr.h, vfsr_opt, TESTS/...:
Rewrote code to pass only local pointer-parameters to and within the
vfsr module.  This is required if anyone wishes to write a user module
to use vfsr recursively, e.g., for self-optimization.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
user.c, vfsr.c:
Removed unnecessary headers for each routine.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Makefile, user.c, user.h, vfsr.c, vfsr.h, vfsr_opt:
Removed ADAPTIVE_OPTIONS, as now Program Options are either defined
in user.c or read in from vfsr_opt using OPTIONS_FILE=TRUE.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
NOTES:
Placed code contributed by Barak Cohen <bardak@ccsg.tau.ac.il> which
can be used on PCs to replace our timing modules.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
vfsr.c:
It was pointed out by Bill Wong <bgwong@holonet.net> that some
machines can have problems assigning a double too large for long int.
We have taken his advice and used temp_dbl in reanneal() to avoid
these problems.

========================================================================
17 Mar 93

NOTES:
Entered "disclaimer" about VFSR being ready as is for recursive use.
On our TODO list is a rewrite dispensing with global parameters.

========================================================================

16 Mar 93

vfsr.c:
The cast on index_cost_repeat was corrected to int.  Thanks to Bill
Wong <bgwong@holonet.net> for finding this error.

vfsr.c:
index_cost_repeat should be reset to 0 whenever a new best state
is found.  Thanks to Walter Roberson <roberson@hamer.ibd.nrc.ca>
for finding this bug.

========================================================================
15 Mar 93
user.h, vfsr.h, vfsr.c:
The cast on MAXIMUM_REANNEAL_INDEX was changed to LONG_INT, as
was originally intended.  Without this change, the default value
of 50000 causes VFSR to fail on some PC's.  Thanks to Barak Cohen
<bardak@ccsg.tau.ac.il> for bringing this problem to our attention.

========================================================================
7 Mar 93

readme.ms:
To avoid confusion between the GNU Public License (GPL) in our COPYING
file and the popular imprecise term "public domain," a modified
statement now is included:
   Please read the copy of this license contained in this directory.
   Our intent is to make this code publicly available to the widest
   audience while maintaining the integrity of the basic algorithm.

========================================================================
28 Feb 93

readme.ms:
Included a brief description of the VFSR algorithm.

========================================================================
26 Feb 93

Makefile, readme.ms:
Inserted a brief discussion on the algebra behind the Program Options
used for annealing.  Equations are set in README.ps.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
TESTS/v..., readme.ms, user.h, user.c, vfsr.c, vfsr.h:
Individual scales for reannealing can be set by the user by setting
both Pre-Compile Options ADAPTIVE_OPTIONS and RATIO_TEMPERATURE_SCALES
to TRUE, and initializing (*USER_OPTIONS).user_temperature_ratio[]
in the user module.

The same approach is now taken to set initial parameter
or cost temperatures, i.e., by initializing the
(*USER_OPTIONS).user_parameter_temperature array or
(*USER_OPTIONS).user_cost_temperature in the user module.
This replaces the kludge of using the previous "hooks."

========================================================================
25 Feb 93

readme.ms:
All descriptions of the DEFINE_OPTIONS in the Makefile are now repeated
in the README[.ps] documentation.  Several people stated they were
initially confused by not seeing any description of these options in
the primary documentation.

========================================================================
24 Feb 93

NOTES:
Added some email correspondence which outlines how vfsr could be used
recursively to optimize its Program Options in a given system, or to
optimize other optimizers.

========================================================================
23 Feb 93

readme.ms:
Added stress that the Makefile contains a short description of the
DEFINE_OPTIONS, and that it should be considered an extension of the
README and README.ps files.  The three methods of passing the Program
Options were broken up into separate sections to stress this feature.

========================================================================
17 Feb 93

readme.ps:
Cleaned up some problems in formating under refer and grefer.
Thanks to Yuan Liu <liu@cs.umd.edu> and James Clark <jjc@ai.mit.edu>
for their help.

========================================================================
16 Feb 93

readme.ps, user.h, vfsr.h:
Added REAL_NO_REANNEAL (-2) and INTEGER_NO_REANNEAL (2) choices to
parameter_type[] to make choices for this parameter more explicit
and user-friendly.  The cast on parameter_type was set back to int.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Makefile, TESTS/v..., readme.ms, user.h, user.c, vfsr.h, vfsr.c:
Increments used in numerical derivatives of individual parameters
can now be set adaptively.  If both Pre-Compile ADAPTIVE_OPTIONS
and DELTA_PARAMETERS are TRUE, then a pointer delta_parameter in the
OPTIONS structure passes these values, overriding the value of DELTA_X.

This leaves parameter_type with 4 alternatives: REAL_TYPE (< 0, but
for compatability 0 still works), INTEGER_TYPE (> 0), REAL_NO_REANNEAL
(-2), and INTEGER_NO_REANNEAL (2).

========================================================================
14 Feb 93

readme.ms:
In the Makefile section, more explicit information was inserted on
the three alternative methods of passing the Program Options.

========================================================================
13 Feb 93

TESTS/v..., readme.ms, user.h, user.c, vfsr.c, vfsr.h:
Added flexibility to parameter_type[].  Most users need only
be concerned that real-valued parameters must be designated by
negative integers and integer-valued parameters must be designated
by positive integers.

Some users may find it useful to include additional information.  If
the absolute value of the parameter_type[] is +-2, +-4, +-6, +-8, then
no derivatives are calculated for this parameter, effectively excluding
it from being reannealed or having its curvature[] calculated.  (This
only effects integer-valued parameters if INCLUDE_INTEGER_PARAMETERS is
set to TRUE.)  If the absolute value is greater than 9, that value is
used to multiply DELTA_X for that variable; therefore, we have set the
cast on *parameter_type to be LONG_INT.  This flexibility can be used
to exclude discontinuous functions from derivative operations, to have
DELTA_X for integer-valued functions be integral, etc.  Odd numbers +-5
and +-7, are reserved for specific user-defined options, as are even
numbers +-6 and +-8 that require bypassing derivative calculations.
(We will keep the other numbers for future VFSR enhancements.)

The utility of having some user-defined flexibility was highlighted
by some correspondence with Bob Goldstein <u09872@uicvm.uic.edu>
and Brooke Paul Anderson <brooke@cco.caltech.edu>.

vfsr.c:
Corrected calculation of diagonal curvatures.

========================================================================
12 Feb 93

readme.ms:
Inserted comment that Makefile is a convenience, not a necessity,
to use VFSR, and that care should be taken to pass the correct
DEFINE_OPTIONS when compiling the files.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
NOTES:
An example of some parameter tuning on a specific problem.

========================================================================
6 Feb 93

vfsr_opt:
Changed name of options_file to vfsr_opt for easier identification
in users' libraries and to truncate this filename to 8 characters.

Other filenames shortened to 8 characters were SHORT2LONG -> SHRT2LNG,
CONVEX_cc -> CONVX_cc, COPYING-LIB -> COPYING.

========================================================================
5 Feb 93

Makefile, options_file, user.c, vfsr.h:
Changed default MAXIMUM_REANNEAL_INDEX=50000 from 100000000 to avoid
problems on machines that cannot handle long int.  Results are not
changed in TESTS.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Makefile, readme.ms, user.[ch], vfsr.[ch], TESTS:
Added CURVATURE_0=FALSE to DEFINE_OPTIONS.  When CURVATURE_0=TRUE,
then only a one-dimensional array, curvature[0], need be passed to
the vfsr module.  This can help when dealing with very large parameter
spaces where the curvature calculations are not required.  curvature[0]
is still maintained a hook for USER_INITIAL_COST_TEMP=TRUE in any case.

The general problem was emphasized by Bob Goldstein
<u09872@uicvm.uic.edu>.

========================================================================
3 Feb 93

Makefile, vfsr.h, user.c:
Set default of TEMPERATURE_ANNEAL_SCALE=1000.0, freeing it from the
previous default of TEMPERATURE_ANNEAL_SCALE=LIMIT_ACCEPTANCES/10.0.

NOTES:
Comments on setting some VFSR options in case premature convergence
is suspected.  Thanks to Wu Kenong <wu@mcrcim.mcgill.edu> for checking
over some of the details.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Makefile, options_file, user.c, user.h:
Added options_file and OPTIONS_FILE=FALSE.  If both
ADAPTIVE_OPTIONS=TRUE and OPTIONS_FILE=TRUE, then the Program Options
are read in from options_file.  This permits more efficient testing
of various Program Options.

This feature was in the original VFSR code, and was added here at
the suggestion of Davyd Norris <daffy@physics.monash.edu.au>.

========================================================================
31 Jan 93

NOTES:
Comments on how to effect an early exit using ADAPTIVE_OPTIONS=TRUE.

========================================================================
27 Jan 93

The issue of balancing user-friendly code versus flexibility for
different machines was re-visited at the suggestion of Davyd Norris
<daffy@physics.monash.edu.au>.

We have gone back to using SMALL_FLOAT as a measure of "smallness"
to avoid several underflow and overflow problems.  This is a general
measure of precision to be expected in log and divide operations in
vfsr.c, and is _not_ equivalent to defining the number of significant
figures of precision.  We expect experts who require this detail
to be able to use the flexibility of the present code to tune it to
their own requirements.

We have retained MAX_FLOAT and MIN_FLOAT for use in EXPONENT_CHECK, but
have made these definitions correspond to typical machine definitions.
We have defined the defaults as MIN_FLOAT=-1.0/SMALL_FLOAT and
MAX_FLOAT=1.0/SMALL_FLOAT.  Variables max_exponent and min_exponent
are now calculated once in vfsr.c, speeding up calculations.

========================================================================
26 Jan 93

vfsr.c:
Corrected rounding algorithm for integers in generate_new_state().
Thanks to Wu Kenong <wu@mcrcim.mcgill.edu> for pointing out this bug.

========================================================================
25 Jan 93

readme.ms, user.c, user.h, vfsr.c, vfsr.h:
*OPTIONS is an optional parameter that can be passed if
ADAPTIVE_OPTIONS=TRUE in the Makefile.  When ADAPTIVE_OPTIONS=FALSE
(the default), all changes in default Program Options DEFINE_OPTIONS
are defined in the Makefile.  (Compiler Options and Printing Options
always are to be set in the Makefile.)  When ADAPTIVE_OPTIONS=TRUE,
all Program Options are defined in the structure OPTIONS, permitting
adaptive changes during repeated searches, or at different recursive
levels of VFSR optimization.  As illustrated in the user module,
if ADAPTIVE_OPTIONS=FALSE, only the typedef int for DEFINES must be
specified to use this format.

This additional flexibility was possessed by the VFSR code before
its public release, and has been useful in some systems requiring
recursive calls to vfsr().

========================================================================
24 Jan 93

TESTS/..., vfsr.c:
Changed format for printing out doubles from 10.5 to 12.7.

NOTES:
Placed some comments on use of DEFINE_OPTIONS for recursive nesting
of VFSR calls.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Makefile, readme.ms, vfsr.c, vfsr.h:
Added additional exit criteria, TOO_MANY_INVALID_STATES, based on
new DEFINE_OPTION, LIMIT_INVALID_GENERATED_STATES (default 1000).

========================================================================
22 Jan 93

NOTES:
Added some comments about using VFSR on systems with constraints and
fine-tuning the DEFINE_OPTIONS.

========================================================================
21 Jan 93

CHANGES, Makefile, readme.ms, vfsr.c, vfsr.h:
Added USER_INITIAL_PARAMETERS_TEMPS=FALSE and to Makefile to permit
user to input initial individual parameter temperatures into *tangents
array.

Added USER_INITIAL_COST_TEMP=FALSE to Makefile to permit user to
input initial cost temperature into curvature[0].

These additional features, discussed in the original VFSR paper and
implemented in the original code, were put back in as suggested by
correspondence with Zbigniew Michalewicz <zbyszek@mosaic.uncc.edu>
and Wu Kenong <wu@mcrcim.mcgill.edu>.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
TEST..., vfsr.c:
Added new DEFINE_OPTIONS to list to be printed out in vfsr_out.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
vfsr.c, vfsr.h:
Added separate time routines for independent tracking of vfsr
calculations.

========================================================================
15 Jan 93

vfsr.c:
Put in specific test to skip reannealing for integer parameters if
the default INCLUDE_INTEGER_PARAMETERS=FALSE.  Previously, it had to
be assumed that tangents[] would be 0 for these cases.

========================================================================
14 Jan 93

Makefile, NOTES, vfsr.c:
SMALL_FLOAT was added to the denominator of the calculation of
delta_cost, to properly handle cases of small current_cost_temperature.

TESTS/..., readme.ms:
This changes the intermediate calculations, causing longer runs after
the best minimum is found, in the test cases for SMALL_FLOAT=E-18/E-20,
but does not affect the final answers or the values of the generating
and acceptance points at the global minimum.  However, now the test
problems do not crash on the Convex for SMALL_FLOAT=E-18, but still do
crash for SMALL_FLOAT=E-20 due to a "Floating exception."

Makefile, user.h, vfsr.h, vfsr.c:
Hooks were placed in user.h and vfsr.h to set machine-dependent
SMALL_FLOAT to MACHEPS, MIN_FLOAT to MIN_REAL, and MAX_FLOAT to
MAX_REAL.  Corresponding DEFINE_OPTIONS were added to Makefile.
To maintain user-friendly and portable code across platforms, we
have set the defaults in terms of SMALL_FLOAT; this agrees with our
previous test results.

Makefile, vfsr.h, vfsr.c:
A DEFINE_OPTIONS was added because some machines, e.g., PC's,  may
choke on `long int' as used in vfsr.c to handle some large dimensions.
Setting INT_LONG=FALSE will use only `int'.

NOTES:
A entry was placed in NOTES explaining the preference for setting all
options in the Makefile, rather than introducing a new initialization
file.

Thanks to Davyd Norris <daffy@physics.monash.edu.au> for finding
this bug, running many test cases on various machines, and causing
us to reevaluate the above issues.

========================================================================
13 Jan 93

user.c, user.h, vfsr.c, vfsr.h:
As previously mentioned in vfsr.h, the original VFSR code passed the
parameter bounds in the cost function, permitting additional adaptive
changes in the search by virtue of decisions made in this calculation.
E.g., setting a lower bound equal to the upper bound of a parameter
has the effect of taking it out of consideration of the search.
This feature has been put back into the code, at the modest expense
of now requiring parameter bounds to be passed by the cost function.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
user.c:
Switched order of "if" tests for PRINT_FREQUENCY to avoid division
by zero.

Thanks to Wu Kenong <wu@mcrcim.mcgill.edu> for pointing out this bug.

========================================================================

12 Jan 93

Makefile, user.c, user.h:
A TIME_CALC=TRUE option was added to DEFINE_OPTIONS.  Several
people were having compilation problems on Mac's and PC's because
of differences in locations of and macro definitions in the time
include files.  Since the relevant code is in the user module, and
not in the vfsr module of our primary concern, we feel the best fix
is just to include this option, where TIME_CALC=FALSE will simply
ignore all this code.

Thanks to Lee Hon Man <89299465@CPHKVX.CPHK.HK> for stressing these
problems in the user module.

========================================================================
20 Dec 92

Makefile, user.c, vfsr.c, vfsr.h:
Changes were made in casts to make the code more portable to 16-bit
machines and to machines that might hold only to the strict ANSI
standards, by changing int -> long int for those variables that might
get large.

Thanks to Davyd Norris <daffy@physics.monash.edu.au> for bringing
this necessity to our attention.  Davyd has pointed out that compiler
"warnings" still are issued, e.g., truncation of some integers on PC's,
but we feel that we only can spend time addressing actual "errors"
in the vfsr module that will actually impair implementation of the
VFSR algorithm.

========================================================================
19 Dec 92

NOTES:
Added some email correspondence from Cygnus, who give support to GNU
products, clarifying some issues in the COPYING-LIB license.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

NOTES:
Added some comments on VFSR use in the presence of complex constraints.

========================================================================
18 Dec 92

NOTES, CHANGES:
Corrected confusing typo that misidentified [m sub i] and [n sub i]
in published papers with their correct implementation in vfsr.c:
TEMPERATURE_ANNEAL_SCALE [n sub i]
TEMPERATURE_RATIO_SCALE  [m sub i]
Some examples calculating these quantities were placed in NOTES.

Thanks to Wu Kenong <wu@mcrcim.mcgill.edu> for pointing out this bug.

========================================================================
17 Dec 92

readme.ms
Inserted  statement:
Since VFSR has not been applied extensively to many systems, it is
certain that there is much research to be done on determining optimal
or even reasonable VFSR parameters, e.g., the set of DEFINE_OPTIONS,
for different classes of systems, especially in higher dimensional
spaces of user parameters.  A major purpose of placing this code in
the public domain is to motivate more of this research, and thus make
the code more useful to a wider audience.

========================================================================
16 Dec 92

VFSR.DIR, Makefile, longname.h, readme.ms:
To accommodate some PC/DOS systems, some changes in name were made.
Since many such systems do not distinguish case, there is a problem
using `sh vfsr' to get the VFSR directory.  Therefore, the name of
the VFSR directory has been changed to VFSR.DIR.

TESTS, Makefile:
The names of files on DOS systems cannot exceed 8 characters plus
3 as a suffix.  The names of the files in TESTS were shortened even
more than previously to permit their unique extraction under `sh vfsr'.

========================================================================
13 Dec 92

Makefile:
On some Dec and Convex machines `make' gets confused by backslashes
("\") at the end of commented lines ("#").  These were taken out of all
commented option lines.

========================================================================
12 Dec 92

NOTES:
Took out names and email addresses of correspondents, as they contact
us without knowing that we might include their comments in this file.

========================================================================
10 Dec 92

readme.ms:
Took %N(S) issue number entries out of file, since references
as formatted here make unclear the distinction between %N and %V
(volume) entries using grefer defaults.  Otherwise, a separate macro
file would have to be included, standard with refer or grefer usage.
This macro file typically would have some control characters, e.g, ^G,
and this could cause problems for some people accessing vfsr via email.

========================================================================
9 Dec 92

vfsr.c:
In the routine cost_derivatives(), there are three places where a
division by a parameter can cause problems when it has value zero
within machine precision.  This did not affect the particular test
problem.  A value of SMALL_FLOAT has been added to those denominators
to prevent any future problems.

Thanks to Leslie Picardo <picardo@alpha.ces.cwru.edu> for finding
this bug.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
readme.ms:
As suggested in the GNU Library General Public License in the
COPYING-LIB file, postal addresses for both authors were inserted.

8 Dec 92

CHANGES, user.c, vfsr.c
Set up headers to automate updating Modification History whenever a
new version is created.

7 Dec 92

vfsr now is in STATLIB as well as NETLIB, permitting interactive or

6 Dec 92

all files:
Set up a patch macro for all revisions past v6.25.  Changed format of

readme.ms, vfsr.c:
The RCS Id string containing version number, and values of all
DEFINE_OPTIONS in the Makefile are now printed out in VFSR_OUT (when
VFSR_PRINT is at its default of TRUE).

vfsr.h, vfsr.c:
The exit code is now passed to vfsr_exit to be printed at the bottom
of VFSR_OUT together with the other summary information.

These changes will help decifer bug reports.

5 Dec 92

vfsr.c:
The present code gives incorrect annealing for negative cost functions.
During the rewrite, an "fabs" was dropped that had insured that the
initial cost temperature would always be positive.  (For example,
during reannealing, at a few places the absolute value of the cost
is taken when used to examine the temperature.)  This bug incorrectly
reverses the acceptance criteria.  The solution is to change:
202c202
<       sampled_cost_sum += current_generated_state.cost;
---
>       sampled_cost_sum += fabs(current_generated_state.cost);

Thanks to Cullen Schaffer <schaffer@marna.hunter.cuny.edu> for finding
this bug.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Makefile, vfsr.c, vfsr.h:
Added ACTIVATE_REANNEAL (default TRUE) to permit overriding
reannealing.  This is a simple addition in one place:

#if ACTIVATE_REANNEAL           /* set to FALSE to skip reannealing */
            /* calculate tangents, not curvatures, to reanneal */
            curvature_flag = FALSE;
            cost_derivatives(user_cost_function);
            reanneal();
#endif

========================================================================
3 Dec 92

Makefile, vfsr.c, vfsr.h:
Changed names of some options to more properly reflect their use as
described in the original 1989 VFSR paper.  Comments were placed in
the Makefile.  The code variables are the logs of the variables in
the paper given in brackets.
TEMPERATURE_SCALE_WEIGHT_PARAM -> TEMPERATURE_ANNEAL_SCALE [n sub i]
TEMPERATURE_SCALE_WEIGHT       -> TEMPERATURE_RATIO_SCALE  [m sub i]


Added COST_PARAMETER_SCALE if user want to override default (1.0)
of resulting cost and parameter temperature scales.

Added INCLUDE_INTEGER_PARAMETERS if user wants to override default
(FALSE) to include integer parameters in derivative and reannealing
calculations.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
vfsr.c
Changed "if" to "while" in reanneal to take care of large indices.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
vfsr.c:
Added some comments on expecting some old instead of current printed
values at very end of vfsr_out if a "premature" call to vfsr_exit.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Makefile, vfsr.c, vfsr.h, readme.ms:
Added USER_INITIAL_PARAMETERS.  Default (FALSE) is to let vfsr
calculate first generated point subject to user's constraints, likely
the most typical case in complex problems.  A statement to this effect
was put into readme.ms.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
readme.ms:
Some people were confused over the GNU COPYING-LIB file, and so the
following statement was added:

Our intent is to make this code available in the public domain to the
widest audience while maintaining the integrity of the basic algorithm.

========================================================================
2 Dec 92

Makefile, vfsr.h, vfsr.c:
Added COST_PRECISION option in Makefile to let user set precision
required of cost function if exiting because MAXIMUM_COST_REPEAT has
been reached.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
user.c, vfsr.c:
Just list Modification History at the top of each file, instead of
in each separate function.  This CHANGES file will include details
of all changes.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
vfsr.c:
An extraneous block of code, a copy of some code at the beginning
of vfsr(), was somehow placed at the end.  This returned nonsense to
the calling routine in cases of *exit_code=NORMAL_EXIT=0.  No changes
were made in TESTS.

The following lines should be deleted from v6.20 in vfsr.c
442,463d441
<     /* copy best parameters and print out results */
<     VFOR(index_v) {
< #if VFSR_PRINT
< 	fprintf(ptr_vfsr_out, "%d\t ", index_v);
< #endif
< 	current_parameter_temperature[index_v] =
< 	    initial_parameter_temperature[index_v] =
< 	    ((double) INITIAL_PARAMETER_TEMPERATURE);
<
< 	/* set the best and last state to the current generated state */
< 	best_generated_state.parameter[index_v] =
< 	    last_saved_state.parameter[index_v] =
< 	    current_generated_state.parameter[index_v];
<
< #if VFSR_PRINT
< 	fprintf(ptr_vfsr_out, "%g\t %g\t %g\t %d\n",
< 		parameter_minimum[index_v],
< 		parameter_maximum[index_v],
< 		current_generated_state.parameter[index_v],
< 		parameter_type[index_v]);
< #endif
<     }

The errors caused by this problem were first discovered by Jacob
Engelbrecht <engel@virus.fki.dth.dk>.

========================================================================
28 Nov 92
gcc-2.3.2 was installed on ingber, so this was used to recalculate
files in TESTS.  gcc-2.3.2 was just a bit faster than gcc-2.3.1.

The Dec machine used in TESTS turned out to be a 3100, not a 5100,
so the names of the appropriate files were changed in TESTS.

========================================================================
27 Nov 92

user.c:
Passed compiler options into main to print out in user_out.

========================================================================
vfsr.c:
sampled_cost_sum was incorrectly declared as int instead of
double.  This caused a crash on one machine due to the large
size of the test cost function.  Also, the cast was changed
to (double) NUMBER_COST_SAMPLES for the initial calculation of
current_generated_state.cost.  (In fact, some code during reannealing
is necessary to avoid such large integers.)

Since this alters the initial cost temperature, the sampling changes,
and the values in vfsr_out are changed.  This just happens to
make the code more "efficient" for this particular set of starting
values.  A new set of test runs was placed in TESTS, but including
SMALL_FLOAT=1.0E-12 instead of SMALL_FLOAT=1.0E-16 to permit some
comparison with a run on a Convex-C120.

Thanks to Jacob Engelbrecht <engel@virus.fki.dth.dk> for first
discovering this error.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
TESTS, Makefile:
shortened names and deleted periods in names of TESTS files to
accommodate some machines.  Older more descriptive long names are
in VFSR/TESTS/SHORT2LONG_NAMES.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Added this file, CHANGES, and a NOTES file to include more
documentation that might be of interest to users.

========================================================================
25 Nov 92

vfsr.[ch]:
Changed void to return double final_cost.  Error introduced in r5 by
passing value instead of pointer. r4 passed pointer but was considered
confusing for some to pass address.

vfsr.[ch]:
Reverted to scheme of r4, wherein one g_[...] variable and several
g_[...] addresses were used in parameter list of vfsr() to make this
local [...] information global to several other small internal vfsr
routines.

user.[ch]:
Changed names of all parameters in user.c passed to vfsr to be
different than those used in vfsr.  This should help to catch any
errors such as the one above involving final_cost.

These changes appear to speed up the program; results were the same.

Thanks to Dan Adler <adan@tudor.com> for first discovering this
blunder.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Added int *exit_status to return reason for exiting vfsr.  A warning
was put in readme.ms not to rely solely on this info.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Acknowledgment to Mark Johnson <mark@microunity.com> added to user.c.

========================================================================
5 Nov 92

Over several revisions, the core of VFSR was extracted out of previous
codes used since 1987, and global name changes were made.  Tests were
run using cost functions from old problems to check the new code.  The
old code had some very good checks performed by fitting a Lagrangian
representation of a set of nonlinear multivariate stochastic
differential equations (SDE's).  I.e., (a) data was generated from the
SDE's; (b) the coefficients were arbitrarily changed; (c) the
Lagrangian representation was processed by VFSR to find the original
coefficients, within the accuracy permitted by the variances of the
original SDE's.  Since then, there have been many different tests, such
as those referenced in the README.

========================================================================
Jan 1991
